# Quick Notepad Extension
Take quick notes with this chrome extension :D

## How can I use it?

I don't have 5 bucks to publish in chrome web store :( So you can run `git clone https://github.com/denis-rossati/quick-notepad-extension`, and then you go to your chrome extension configuration, turn on the developer mode, click in "load unpacked" and choose the folder with my project.

## Why I made this?

I've used several notepad extensions before. I easily forget my thoughts or what I'm going to say in some meetings and DMs, and those extensions have a backend connection (and most of the time, a bad connection) and I end up forgetting what I was going to say. Aiming to solve these problems, I made a very simple but ~ more useful notepad that solves my anxiety problem.
